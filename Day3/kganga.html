    <h1>kanchanajunga</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Kangchenjunga, also spelled Kanchenjunga, KanchanjanghƒÅ and Khangchendzonga, is the third-highest mountain in the world. Its summit lies at 8,586 m (28,169 ft) in a section of the Himalayas, the Kangchenjunga Himal, which is bounded in the west by the Tamur River, in the north by the Lhonak River and Jongsang La, and in the east by the Teesta River.[1][5] It lies in the border region between Nepal and Sikkim state of India, with three of the five peaks, namely Main, Central and South, directly on the border,[6] and the peaks West and Kangbachen in Nepal's Taplejung District.[7]

        Until 1852, Kangchenjunga was assumed to be the highest mountain in the world, but calculations and measurements by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India in 1849 showed that Mount Everest, known as Peak XV at the time, is actually higher. After allowing for further verification of all calculations, it was officially announced in 1856 that Kangchenjunga was the third-highest mountain,[8] after Everest and K2 of Karakoram.[9]</p>
